Wcf Rest Contrib
=============

The WCF REST Contrib library adds functionality to the current WCF REST implementation.

NOTE: I am no longer actively developing this library and I encourage you not to use it unless absolutely necessary. WCF is a terrible platform for building RESTful services. There are a number of frameworks out there like [OpenRasta](https://github.com/openrasta/openrasta-stable/wiki) that do a *much* better job of it. Friends don't let friends use WCF for REST.
